    cookTime: '25 mins',
    servings: 4,
    ingredients: [
      '1 box (16 oz) spaghetti',
      '8 slices bacon, cut into small pieces',
      '4 large eggs',
      '1 cup grated parmesan cheese',
      'Black pepper to taste',
      '1 teaspoon salt (for pasta water)',
      '2 cloves garlic, chopped (optional but adds great flavor!)'
    ],
    instructions: [
      'First, fill a large pot with water (about 3/4 full) and add 1 teaspoon of salt. The salt helps flavor the pasta!',
      'Turn the heat to high and wait for big bubbles to appear (that\'s boiling!). Add your spaghetti and stir gently so it doesn\'t stick together.',
      'While the pasta cooks, put the bacon pieces in a large pan on medium heat. TIP: Start with a cold pan - it helps bacon cook more evenly!',
      'Cook the bacon until it\'s crispy and brown (about 5-7 minutes). Remove it from the pan but keep the bacon fat - it adds flavor!',
      'In a large bowl, crack the eggs and add the cheese. Mix them together with a fork until well combined. This will be your creamy sauce!',
      'IMPORTANT: Before draining the pasta, scoop out 1 cup of the pasta water and set it aside. This starchy water helps make the sauce creamy!',
      'Drain the pasta in a colander, but don\'t rinse it! The starch helps the sauce stick better.',
      'Working quickly (while pasta is still very hot), put the pasta back in the pot and add the bacon.',
      'Now for the tricky part: Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta and stir quickly! The heat from the pasta will cook the eggs into a creamy sauce.',
      'If it looks too thick, add a little of your reserved pasta water (start with 1/4 cup) and stir until it\'s just right.',
      'Finish with lots of black pepper on top. More cheese is always welcome too!'

      'Spread sweet potatoes out - TIP: Give them space! Crowded vegetables steam instead of getting crispy.',

      'Put chickpeas on another baking sheet, drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil, add salt and any spices you like.',
      'When the sweet potatoes have been in for 5 minutes, add the chickpeas to the oven. They\'ll need about 20 minutes to get crunchy.',
      'While everything\'s cooking, tear your kale into bite-sized pieces. TIP: Remove the tough stems first!',
      'Put kale in a bowl and squeeze half a lemon over it. Use your hands to massage the kale for about 1 minute - this makes it softer and tastier!',
      'When everything\'s ready, build your bowls: quinoa on the bottom, then arrange your roasted sweet potatoes, chickpeas, and kale in sections.',
      'Cut your avocado in half, remove the pit, and slice it while it\'s still in the skin. Scoop out with a spoon for perfect slices!',
      'Drizzle with tahini sauce and squeeze the remaining lemon over everything. Add more salt and pepper if needed.'
